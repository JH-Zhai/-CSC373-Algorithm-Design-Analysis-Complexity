The answer is no. 
Our modified Dijkstra follow the original workflow, especially, it doesn't change how algrithm dicied wich node to visit next nor how to compare which path is shorter.
So it cannot handle negative edge with cycle. And it may report false easiest path or false toughness. Counter example as below:

insert graph here->

If we start from s. algrithm will decide shortest path to to v is s -> v, and the toughness of v is 3. But the true shortest path to v is s -> u -> v, and toughness of this path is 4. So our algrithm does not guarantee to work correctly this time.
